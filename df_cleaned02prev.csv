First, attendant at EVT-110 pressed the e-stop button. After doing a powercycle, arms went into {{requires_intervention}} state.

When trying to recover the arms through Franka UI, the team noticed that e-stop was ‘triggered’ according to the Franka UI-- which is not the case according to the attendant.

Rebooting the arm through Franka UI multiple times eventually resolved the issue, then eventually able to recover the arms.

The bracket 600-000241 was measured and confirmed that M3 holes have a tapped depth of 2.80mm (3mm required from the drawing), which could be contributing to this issue.

The cable chain is currently fixed using M3x6 screws 690-000146.

With CSK screw in the cable chain hole, we have 3.45mm of threads exposed (see below). 

[^20240604_135508.jpg]

We tried using an M3x4mm screw which worked fine, and fixed the cable chain in place. Since this was just for the experiment, the screw was removed from the frame right away.

With a pitch of 0.5mm, the screw(s) would only engage only three threads in the bracket’s hole. This could be enough for this application.

This issue was not found on other REL units while testing the armrest, as the bellow tracks adjustment wasn't performed at that time.

This adjustment is done on the screws shown below, which in turn raise or lower the side panels, which causes the issue in the object. This was done on all REL units, except one (#103) between yesterday and today.

!20240719_141222.jpg|width=4032,height=2268,alt=""20240719_141222.jpg""!

----

The bellow tracks are aligned using a blue gauge block with a height of 52mm. The upper track is fixed to a non-machined surface of the welded frame, *which is usually not planar* (red line in the picture). 

!Bellow tracks height adjustment.png|width=383,height=281,alt=""Bellow tracks height adjustment.png""!

With 52mm being the minimum distance required, the cable carriage 600-000156 is often adjusted (purple arrows) to be lower than what’s designed.

The side panels 600-000719/725 are mounted on the cable chain carriage and move down by the same magnitude. The mounting bracket 600-000649, installed on the side panels, also moves down.

This is where the snap fits of the top cover are supposed to hook. On this specific unit, the top cover cannot clamp to the mounting bracket, and therefore the top cover cannot be fixed.

!Untitled2.png|width=370,height=407,alt=""Untitled2.png""!

Considerations: 

The bellow tracks adjustment causes a chain reaction that eventually moves the mounting bracket 600-000649.

The adjustment on the cable carriage is unique for each unit as it’s based on the planarity of the frame on the surface where the upper bellow track is fixed. For this reason, corrective action would have to be taken to make it work for any potential deviation from the ideal position of the mounting bracket.

The armrest cover plastic parts are not installed at either TONO or Compal, so this issue may not be noticed before units leave Taiwan.

!image-20240708-074251.png|width=100%,alt=""image-20240708-074251.png""!

We suspect there are two ways that caused this issue, one is the 600-000910 is the mockup sample, and that has lower strength.
And the other way, we need to tilt a little bit when we fasten the screw, we are worried about that will be bending the threaded insert and cause that pull-out.

The current top plate of 600-000934 interferes with the tool required to install the Rosalina module to the part. 

As a result, the assemblers are required to  assemble the mounting screws for 600-000910 at an angle, which puts a side load on the threaded inserts. This has been a problem for current ChauYih produced parts. However, these parts are currently being machined out of plastic (TBD what plastic is being used). 

Although we expect there to be less issues with the heat stakes binding to the tooled plastic parts, we want to eliminate the side loading on the insert during the assemby process. 

For this reason, Compal has suggested including some cutouts in the flat mounting plate on 600-000934 to allow for correct (straight) assembly of the screws.

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Config Be Cable,Lower bellows guide blocks install of bolster wings,"During a practice DVT unit installation, [~accountid:712020:97d5b64a-a5c2-4d36-9451-4d725988dfac] found that the lower bellows track is interfering with the hex key used to install the screws securing the bolster wing to its carriage. See picture for reference. After removing the lower track, the wings could be installed normally.

* Kevin checked that the bellow slides could move freely between the upper and lower tracks, so most likely the spacing between upper and lower tracks was correct. 
* Kevin confirmed that installers would be unlikely to find & purchase a low-profile key that could fit.

Can we confirm the path forward here? Removing the track during field install is very time-consuming and not recommended. The recommendation is to ship with the track off of the frame. Installers would add the track on site. FYI, this means the center bellows and the bellows slide assemblies also need to ship off of the frame.

We need to decide what to do before barebones production gets too far ahead.

This issue was found by [~accountid:712020:97d5b64a-a5c2-4d36-9451-4d725988dfac] and [~accountid:712020:32b18c75-ec68-4c15-84a7-0071140a8da0] today. They inspected for any other cause of blockage and confirmed it to be the damper. It is a P0 failure event and can result in a user being trapped by this right side arm. 

This problem with the damper was discovered during the first units being built in DVT and the solution is currently undergoing validation. There should be a plan in place for preventing this issue on EVT-retrofit units in the field.

Also it is worth noting that this appears to be a very early pre-EVT-exit design of the robot base which did not go through reliability testing.

Update on the limit switch disengagement for the DVT unit right arm:

* Wiggling the limit switch cable on the right side arm caused the signal to change to disengaged. The pin’s in limit switch connector don’t appear correct and/or are hot glued to deep to not have engagement. Will remove and investigate the pin’s on the connector on Monday.
* NOTE: this DVT unit shipped without robot bases so we put on the REL 843-000043 assembly level bases which did not have peach boards - we added on a peach board from EVT, but the issue seems to be with the switch assembly.
* NOTE 2: measured a 0.57mm compression length on left side switch, and 0.41mm compression length on right side switch - we know that the max deflection that can be created before magnets disengage is 0.2mm so these switches will remain in their operating range throughout massage
* NOTE 3: there is MFG-000062 test done where we load the robot base with 30% more torque than largest massage force and confirm that there is no limit switch signal change for 10s - this should catch any disengagements due to deflection at the factory.

Summary of feed back from [~accountid:6112f556ec92ab00702eb7a7] for reference

[@Scott White|https://aescape.slack.com/team/U04L1999ZAQ] [@Bill|https://aescape.slack.com/team/U05B41ESU00] [@Josh|https://aescape.slack.com/team/U05JJ01MMLL] - here's my notes from going through the provisioning process on 3, and the commissioning process on 4, units at compal this week.  sorry i wasn't able to give in more real time, it was fairly hectic this week:


+Provisioning+

* Add note that unit needs to be powered on for >60s prior to starting provisioning process
* Need to turn on robot control boxes before starting as well - a few were off
* Need to add step to lower armrest to home position so that headrest can be installed for hipot test (or have Tono send the frames with it in the lower position - per Nick N it sounds like this may already be happening)

+Commissioning+

* Add that system needs to be powered for ~10 minutes before starting commissioning.  The perception node auto updates firmware on first boot, which makes the cameras appear to not work - and the best solution they have for problems is to power cycle the unit, which is exactly what you don’t want to do during a fw update.  Ideally we can eventually have the perception node publish the status so we can display on the app, but for now just letting it run works.
* Unclear to operators which side of robot is left vs right - should clarify
* Step 5 - QR code doesn’t always show, especially with unhomed actuators, but the procedure requires it to show before moving on
* Step 5 and 6 - it’s not specified that you need to enter the code to get to debug mode on the app versions with the commissioning toolkit
* Steps 12-16 - cannot be done, cameras are not on poles during commissioning
* Step 32 - leg bolster to end will cause collision with rails
* Peripherals - for armrest and leg bolster, as soon as you home they go into error

* Need to home, then hit “move to start” to get passed this step.  Seems like a firmware bug

* Step 20 - stuck on initialized until you home all the axes
* Step 25+ - it’s very confusing what the “Target” and “Actual” positions are, because you need to read the target from the logs - it would be easier to add a “Target” line next to the actual.

* Additionally, the operators were quite confused by doing the math on the tolerances - it might be easier to just have this automatically check in SW and show a green/red indicator of if it’s within tolerance

* Need to add a note that cameras need to be pointing at the ceiling - on one unit, they had the poles upside down so the cameras were pointing at the pads - which returns a pure white image - which is the same color as the background of the screen, so it looks like no image
* Need to move rails and bolster to right position for packing - should add button to move rail and bolster to the correct positions.  For rails this is possible, but they need to dial it in using the slider, which is difficult to be precise with.  For bolster, the only way we could do this through commissioning app was to command a move to end, then estop when it was in the right place.  I think it would be easier to have buttons to that just command both of those to the correct positions.

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Mario Micro Usb,CM fails to cancel stroke if arms retract to Idle before the HEZ robot error is received,"This can be reproduced by triggering a HEZ error while paused. While MM does receive feedback that the cancel request was accepted, the actual stroke cancellation does not happen in CM, and MM is stuck waiting for it forever. This has happened at PRESS, depending on timing between CM switching to recovery and MM handling the error.



If HEZ is handled before CM detects recovery, goals are canceled fine



CM should display {{Stroke canceled while executing,}} but it doesn’t show any cancellation.

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Robot Base Bracket,Robot End-Cap Design Failing FCC Class B,"Luna-1 has been certified to FCC Class A limits, and the scope of this ticket will be to track and implement improvements needed to meet Class B (residential) limits.

The 1/25/24 scan yielded in passing result of Class B margins with additional design improvements in place:

* Added ferrite cores to all DC output cables of Delta 700W PSU, including DC Fan
* Robot end-cap design requires metallic shielding
* Emissions due to linear rail motion should be closely monitored during subsequent scans due to component change from FD060-10-EM to FMP060-10-EM. In FD060-10-EM ferrite cores on all input/output communication cabling was required

See more detail here: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15gEv6z_rJVG5awmTD7Wv20i5V5bwLpNPe3A9CDZ7KVc/edit#slide=id.g2b3b25cd88e_0_99|https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15gEv6z_rJVG5awmTD7Wv20i5V5bwLpNPe3A9CDZ7KVc/edit#slide=id.g2b3b25cd88e_0_99|smart-link]

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Robot Base E-Magnet,Need limit switch rewire on EVT106 to support latest updates,"*Observations as of 2024-08-27:*
The limit switch signal on EVT-106 for the right side rail, is connected to input 2 on the AMC servo drive, instead of input 1, as per DVT spec. This was tested by monitoring the live limit switch signal using ACE software.

*Possible root cause:*
During retrofit, EVT106 was wired such that the right limit switch for the rails was connected to input 2 of the AMC servo drive (from recent observations). This was necessary at the time most likely because the right side servo drive on EVT106 was reported to have a burnt pin for input 1 on the 15-pin D-SUB receptacle (female end) (picture attached), so the retrofit team probably decided to use input 2 at the time (conjecture).

Today, we encountered two problems:

# During the provisioning process, the ""Arm-Setup"" step failed. The log indicated that it was unable to connect to the left arm. After investigating, we discovered that the Perception-PC and Control-PC were incorrectly placed, causing the arms to connect to the Perception-PC instead of the Control-PC. Once we corrected the placement, this issue was resolved.

# After resolving the first issue, the ""Arm-Setup"" still failed at the next step. The log showed:


{{ ""aescape_utils_py.franka_client.client.FrankaException: UnprocessableContent: Cannot set end effector, check whether needed features are installed.""}}

Bill mentioned this is likely an issue with Franka, and we’ll need the Franka team to address it. He suggested swapping to a new Franka control box to continue the provisioning process. However, the Compal team noted that the swap could take hours or even days. While they proceed with the swap, we began provisioning the second frame, which was also newly assembled today. Unfortunately, the provisioning halted at the same step, indicating that this second frame's Franka control box also has the same issue.The Compal team is requesting confirmation tonight (Taiwan time) on whether we need to wait for Franka's support. If that's the case, they will halt the assembly process until the issue is resolved.

Need an additional QC for this. Would also be good to include these connections in the Bilt instructions, even if they will not be performed by Ricoh. For easy troubleshooting.

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Bolt,Massage Pose Feature Flag Error,"h2. Description

Massage paused unexpectedly. Member noted seeing a message noting “adjustments” but was not sure what the message was [“adjustments complete” perhaps?]. Member was unable to resume massage – despite the standard “massage paused” message displayed on Engage, the “play” button was not responsive. There was no spinning circle or any other error on Engage. Other features (“end massage early” for example) were responsive and seem to be working appropriately. 


Issue was due to a misconfiguration – Massage Pose monitor flag was turned on. We don't have features flags so QA has to manage them in multiple workarounds. This is error prone by design.

From [~accountid:640833507655a3223a24d923] 

The flag was turned on for System Monitor after the stack restart which was why it was pausing the massage but not turned on in Engage so it wasn't communicating why it paused. It was due to accidentally having the bundle with it turned on started on 114 and we've manually turned off the flag so restarting the stacks turned it back on.

# We've added it to our SOP to confirm the flags are set as expected every time we update/restart the stacks
# Restarted the stacks on EVT114 with the Massage Pose turned off bundle so it will be persistent after stack restart.

Update on the limit switch disengagement for the DVT unit right arm:

* Wiggling the limit switch cable on the right side arm caused the signal to change to disengaged. The pin’s in limit switch connector don’t appear correct and/or are hot glued to deep to not have engagement. Will remove and investigate the pin’s on the connector on Monday.
* NOTE: this DVT unit shipped without robot bases so we put on the REL 843-000043 assembly level bases which did not have peach boards - we added on a peach board from EVT, but the issue seems to be with the switch assembly.
* NOTE 2: measured a 0.57mm compression length on left side switch, and 0.41mm compression length on right side switch - we know that the max deflection that can be created before magnets disengage is 0.2mm so these switches will remain in their operating range throughout massage
* NOTE 3: there is MFG-000062 test done where we load the robot base with 30% more torque than largest massage force and confirm that there is no limit switch signal change for 10s - this should catch any disengagements due to deflection at the factory.

After successfully installing one nut onto the mattress stud of dvt014, the 2nd nut would not go on. To finish the install, the process was changed.

For the camera pole assemblies, there is no indication as to which camera connection goes where. If they are interchangeable, then that should be stated.

For connections that are already made during the manufacturing process, a clear list of where they go should be included as well. Then, if a connection is missed, it is easier for Ricoh to trouble shoot.

After successful body scan, massage paused multiple times and continued to pause even when Member used the “move on” feature. Massage strokes were during the upper back section. Onsite Partner attendant noted that Member’s husband was in the room with her during the massage. Member elected to end massage early due to repeated arm disengagements

From [~accountid:712020:4ada4f4a-b5e6-4d5a-8d0a-573f794bc8e3] The member had moved significantly from their initial bodyfit and we definitely tell they're moving around or someone is kneeling next to the table.

The member is also significantly off of the center line, and their shoulders are pretty uneven. I also noticed in several cases that we'd get an HEZ violation on one side and also get a different violation like a torque, position, or discontinuity violation on the left side at the same time (before one arm has managed to tell the other that its in recovery). That suggests a lot of performance variance around the shoulders in general. The new massage pose restrictions that are in {{24.19.1}} would have rejected this pose.

*Summary from Columbus Circle Incident*

Colin was doing the magnet disengagement check on DVT 001 (Columbus Circle setup). the left robot base was disengaging during the test stroke. he tried to realign strike plate 3 times but was unsuccessful. when I arrived on site I did the process once and was unsuccessful. I noticed when I started touching the cable that connects to the magnet, the magnet was shutting off. found that the crimps on the connector of the magnet were pretty far out.

Checked the status of the armrest in the Engage commissioning app, and it was showing that it was homed despite not being homed. Was able to home it by repeatedly pressing {{home}} in the commissioning app.

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Bolt,EVT106 & EVT015 - Bolster Homing Issue,"As reported by [~accountid:61ae39aed5986c006a81ba0e] 
Hi folks, in my conversation with [@Henry Xue|https://aescape.slack.com/team/U075AKSKHQQ] yesterday (when discussing ticket [PLAT-1498|https://aescape.atlassian.net/browse/PLAT-1498]), I realized that the leg bolster on EVT-106 does not always home cleanly (this was news to me, it may not be news to you - I was told that the QA team has basically decided to live with this as a minor inconvenience). In short, we may require a hardware inspection. More details below.The symptoms: Once the leg bolster has been moved all the way to the topmost position (as close to the headrest as possible), it gets 'stuck'. Any subsequent calls to home the leg bolster may or may not start moving the bolster towards the foot of the table, and as such, multiple homing commands may be necessary. The knock-on effect is that the peripherals node sets this as the new home position for the bolster (which is incorrect).My theory: I'm reasonably certain that the peripherals node considers a component homed when it reads a spike in the value of the measured current. This means that if the leg bolster is stuck in place, then a homing command may fail to move the bolster, but the current spike in the CANbus message means that the bolster is considered to be homed. The net effect is that the wrong position of the bolster is reported to the TF tree, which is undesirable since this value is used for collision checking against the rails.Affected systems: We have confirmed that this issue only affects the units retrofitted with the DVT rail ballscrew (that's EVT106 and EVT105). Henry was also able to confirm that this issue was only observed after the retrofit, and that the bolster movement was good prior to the hardware change.Next steps: I'd like to request some assistance from the hardware team to track down why the bolster gets stuck in the topmost position. Especially on EVT-106, we'd like to get this root-caused/fixed ASAP since this is blocking the QA team from correctly testing the collision prevention behavior between the leg bolster and the linear rails. What was originally considered a minor annoyance by the QA team has now been discovered as being a major HW risk. A ticket to capture this issue is here: [https://aescape.atlassian.net/browse/HW-520|https://aescape.atlassian.net/browse/HW-520|smart-link] .","leg bolster on EVT-106 does not always home cleanly, Once the leg bolster has been moved all the way to the topmost position (as close to the headrest as possible), it gets 'stuck', Any subsequent calls to home the leg bolster may or may not start moving the bolster towards the foot of the table,","issue was only observed after the retrofit, and that the bolster movement was good prior to the hardware change, The knock-on effect is that the peripherals node sets this as the new home position for the bolster (which is incorrect), peripherals node considers a component homed when it reads a spike in the value of the measured current, means that if the leg bolster is stuck in place, then a homing command may fail to move the bolster, but the current spike in the CANbus message means that the bolster is considered to be homed, net effect is that the wrong position of the bolster is reported to the TF tree, which is undesirable since this value is used for collision checking against the rails.",Testing,Function

*DVT-005 has a damaged Franka arm*. Specifically the torque sensor in joint 6 is broken.This is the cause of the behavior reported in[#eng-team|https://aescape.slack.com/archives/C5V714ZM4] [here|https://aescape.slack.com/archives/C5V714ZM4/p1724100666140979].

The issue is tracked on our shared Jira board with Franka as [SBA-29|https://franka.atlassian.net/browse/SBA-29].

This issue is not raised as an error to any interface with have with Franka. Franka is verifying if this currently shows as an error in their system. Likely, a new feature on the Franka side will be required for us to automatically identify this or we will need to extend self-tests with our own behaviors. 



h2. Core Problem

Failures that degrade arm performance cannot be silent. They must be clearly raised and exposed to the Aescape system so that we do not continue giving massages on an arm where servicing is required. 



h2. Issue Manifestation

Joint 6 will not be able to hold it’s position when in guiding mode. Instead the joint slowly rotates.

h3. Steps to Reproduce: (On DVT005)

# Power cycle the device
# On Calibration screen, start calibration
# Verify calibration is successful

h4. Expected:
Calibration should be successful

h4. Actual:

Camera calibration is unsuccessful. It’s complaining “{{Timeout while waiting for future to complete}}"". There is a retry button, but retrying several times does not fix this issue.

If we assume [roll, pitch, yaw, x, *_y_*, z], it looks like the touchpoint velocity spikes to -0.52 in the base_frame y-direction before data stops being logged when recovery mode is triggered. So it could be that momentum combined with the sudden reduction in friction force from switching to recovery mode caused the arm to be momentarily at -0.7m/s during the transition to recovery mode.

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Bolt,Excessive Gap between Bellow Slider and Top Track,"We discovered a large gap between the bellows/ bellow slider and the top track on DVT Unit 3.



!image-20240705-112341.png|width=573,height=756,alt=""image-20240705-112341.png""!

We measured the distance between the bottom track and the top track on DVT 3 and DVT 4: we found that DVT 3  measured 60.5 mm and DVT4 measured 58.6 (closer to nominal dimension). So DVT3 has roughly 2mm of extra clearance between the bellow tracks.

It also appears that the tracks are not sitting parallel to each other--i.e. the top track is straight (against the frame) and the bottom track, which rests on the cable chain bracket, seems to sit at an angle relative to the horizontal. This is likely due to the cable chain bracket not being perfectly parallel to the frame.

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Bolt,Lotte Palace Unit EVT110 Too Noisy,"The purpose of this effort is to organize and execute on retrofits for EVT110 at the Lotte Palace (Beta 2). The preliminary feedback is that the EVT power supply is too loud for the environment, leading to negative UX at a premium location. Would like to come together with a plan on how we can most quickly gather material to successfully retrofit.

Currently, the only power supply with tuned fun for lower audible noise that we have in the US is installed on the unit EVT114 at Press Spa. This power supply has the EVT-power configuration, but DVT-audible noise. This would be drop-in replaceable to the Lotte unit with no other component swaps needed.

In addition to the quieter fan, the DVT power supply has an improved power budget that is enabled by changes to cabling and Daisy, which also ripple to the Servo Drive. The EVT105 and EVT106 units have these upgrades. If a DVT power supply is procured, we should be updating all of the retrofits at the same time (PSU, Daisy, cabling, servos) to avoid future unit down-time for remaining retrofits. EVT+ effort has been tracking these retrofits, but the current projected date for material is at the end of July.

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Bolt,Joint Position Error (Touchpoints Colliding),"Massage was undergoing when the right arm triggered a recovery event. This is most likely due to the touchpoints colliding (as seen in video below). This put the arm in recovery state with the joints locked. Software intervention did not work (rebooting the right arm was attempted unsuccessfully three times). Solution was to unlock the joint manually using an enabler.

I think we experienced a similar issue last week at EVT-114 when [@Adrian Kombe|https://aescape.slack.com/team/U075FCCKB6X] and the team performed maintenance. The left line rail was 'disconnected' in the engage app and the issue was fixed by performing multiple power cycles. I'm not completely sure if the rails are good in the backend because I didn't have a chance to check their status in the terminal. However, I assume that the rails are indeed connected since Adrian and the team confirmed that they didn't do anything else (just confirmed that rails are indeed connected) but power cycled it.

Kev Sanislo and Collin were commissioning EVT-107 and noticed that the left rail was not active in the Engage app. They tried powercycling multiple times (with 15 minute wait time), and the issue persisted.

[~accountid:61ae39aed5986c006a81ba0e]  and I checked the status of the left rail through the {{control_ros2}} shell, and it was indeed active. We then restarted the control PC using CLI ({{ae kill}} then {{ae launch stable.yaml}}). 

We then heard the characteristic click of the rails brakes, logs were healthy, and the live railstate was also good. Engage showed both rails as connected, and then issued a Homing request from Engage itself. Engage was showing that the rails weren’t successfully homed, but when checking the railstate and the logs, both rails were indeed homed. 

We then restarted all the stacks through agents, and only then did we get the machine into a fully functional state, and got to see the status of the rails being in sync with the Engage app and the backend. 

*Scenario 2: linear rails shows as disconnected on both the backend and the Engage app*

[<Slack conversation for additional context>|https://aescape.slack.com/archives/C06FE6LDUAF/p1721070033181539]

Same day as the previous scenario (around 2:50PM - 3:10PM), EVT-114 failed a bodyscan because of the left rail. This time around, the Engage app, the logs, and the ros command all say that the rail is not active.

Restarting the stacks through agents did not work, but powercycling (10 minutes wait time) did the trick.

For this unit, the operator pulled it out by hand fastening during the assembly. (I've fixed it as well)
We suspect that the threaded insert strength is too low and it is easy to pull it out, so we suggest not only increasing the strength but canceling the screw adhesive. (Because the adhesive lets us need a larger torque value to screw it.)

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Bolt,Table State becoming Out-Of-Sync with BE,"Currently there are edge cases when a table’s status (i.e. needs-cleaning, assist-request, robot-homing-status, e-stop-status, massage-status, etc) becomes out-of-sync between the BE and the actual state.

Engage and the BE team worked on a solution which will allow Engage and BE to re-sync on table status (see below).  The implementation of the solution is in-progress and is documented in this ticket ([https://aescape.atlassian.net/browse/EN-1198|https://aescape.atlassian.net/browse/EN-1198|smart-link] 

Solution:

# On Engage startup, it gets the table’s status from the BE via GET {{/devices/:deviceID/table}} API call
## Engage only takes statuses that it relies on from BE (i.e. Assist-Request, Needs-Cleaning, etc).
## If the Assist-Request state is {{“AssistAcknowledged"",}} because it’s a transient state, take one of these two options and put Engage in the state corresponding to it: (I feel like “cancel-call” is a better choice because it’s allows Engage to be in a clean/operating state on startup)
### make a call to POST {{""/devices/:deviceID/cancel-call""}} to cancel the Assist-Request
### make a call to POST {{""/devices/:deviceID/call-attendant""}} to request for Assistance
# For table statues that should come from the device itself (i.e. E-Stopped, Homing-Status, Massage-Status, etc), update the BE by making status-update API calls as required:
## POST {{""/devices/:deviceID/e-stop""}}
## POST {{""/devices/:deviceID/needs-homing""}} or {{""/devices/:deviceID/homing-in-progress""}} or {{""/devices/:deviceID/homed""}}
## POST {{""/devices/:deviceID/pause-massage""}} or {{""/devices/:deviceID/resume-massage""}} (if massage can be resumed)
## POST {{""devices/:deviceID/massage-sessions/:sessionID""}} to restart or end a massage (if massage cannot be resumed)



Example of how Engage and BE states get out-of-sync:

* whenever e-stop is activated, there should be two calls to the e-stop {{/devices/:deviceID/e-stop}} endpoint - one to set it and one to clear it
* upon clearing the e-stop, Engage also should send {{/devices/:deviceID/initialize-status}} endpoint to reset the table status
* attached are the call logs to each of these endpoints for the past two weeks in PROD
*# there are 10 calls to the {{/devices/:deviceID/e-stop}} endpoint
*#* this means there should be 5 calls to the {{/devices/:deviceID/initialize-status}} endpoint if everything worked correctly
*# there are 20 calls the {{/devices/:deviceID/initialize-status}}- this can mean many things, but importantly:
*## the {{/devices/:deviceID/e-stop}} is not always called when clearing the e-stop, resulting Engage and BE becoming out-of-sync in table states
*## the {{/devices/:deviceID/e-stop}} and {{/devices/:deviceID/initialize-status}} are both called on clearing the e-stop, but Engage and BE still becomes out-of-sync in table states, requiring operators to call  using the admin-tool. 

The evidence above indicates the current implementation is inadequate, and the proposed solution above is mean to address this deficiency.

It is crucial to highlight that for Compal’s module products, the lead time from order placement to shipment is 21 weeks. This means that if we receive Compal's PO in late August, the delivery would be scheduled for February 2025.

Additionally, we recently received a notification from our linear rail supplier that they have received a large order from another customer, which will occupy the factory’s production capacity. Even if we place an order now, the parts delivery has already been delayed until February 2025 or later.

Other suppliers, including LTSY and MTS parts suppliers, have also indicated that their production capacity may be occupied by other customers' orders, leading to longer lead times than usual.

To summarize, we kindly ask Aescape for assistance with the following:

Apparel,Armrest Cushion,Bolt,DVT Build | QC step in the SOP needs an alternative solution,"We found the QC step which is we need to check the torque value after we screw these fasteners (As below images show).
Unfortunately, we didn't have similar tools to check the torque value after fastening, even though we started the purchase procedure today, I thought we would not be on time to get the tools. (The internal procedure lead time is about 4 weeks) 

Aescape team could help to share the details about this QC step, Do we have any B plan about this inspection step if we don't have a torque wrench?

Thank you so much.
